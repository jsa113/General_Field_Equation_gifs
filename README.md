# General_Field_Equation_gifs
Animated gifs of the general field equations derived in my report (link). The captions for which are closely related to the other field plots found in the report. They show the evolution of the solution as t is increased.

Note the scales along the x and z axes may be in terms of \rho or x10^8m.

These gifs were produced by using the streamplots functions within matplotlib.pyplot at multiple time-steps and stitched together.
